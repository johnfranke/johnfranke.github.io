# Work Day Scheduler

# Description

This is a work day scheduler. This app allows a user to input text into a certain hour of the day.  The application displays timeblocks for standard business hours (9 a.m. to 5 p.m.). Once text is entered, the user will click the 'save' button and their input will be stored in 'localStorage', allowing the text to persist when the application is refreshed. If the user wants to delete an event, they can by deleting their input and clicking the 'save' button.

The current day and time is displayed near the top of the calendar. Also, each timeblock is color coded to indicate whether it is in a past, present, or future hour.
