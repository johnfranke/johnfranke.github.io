## Weather Dashboard

## Description

The user is first prompted with the title of the app (Check The Weather) and then asked to input a city into the search bar. Once the user clicks the search button the current conditions of the city they searched will show on the left (or below if smaller screen). Under that a 5 day forecast for that city will also show. 

When the user searches for a city that city will be stored in localStorage and will prepend to their 'previous searches' list under the search bar. The user can refresh the page and their previous searches will still be in their list. If the user would like to they can clear that list by clicking on the 'Clear History' button below the previous searches.

I used html, javascript, css, the OpenWeather API, and the Moment.js library to create a weather dashboard.
