### Portfolio Update

I updated my portfolio to an original design using HTML, CSS, and javascript. It is a mobile-first design with a list of projects with links to the deployed version and GitHub repositories along with a screenshot of the applications. I also added links to my LinkedIn, GitHub, and resume.

### Updated LinkedIn, GitHub Profile and Resume 

Updatedl my LinkedIn Profile with a strong bio statement, a professional photo, and links to my Github and portfolio. I updated my GitHub profile picture, bio, location and a link to my portfolio. I also pinned some repos that I want to highlight. Along with the LinkedIn and GitHub profiles, I updated my resume tailed to the type of job I'm looking for.
